# Friendly Ledger

Friendly Ledger is a small local-first React/Supabase app for relaxed shared ledgers.

## Get Going

Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm
- Docker Desktop

From a fresh clone:

```sh
npm run get-going
```

The script installs npm dependencies when needed, opens and waits for Docker Desktop on macOS, starts the local Supabase stack, starts local Edge Functions, starts Vite on LAN, writes ignored local developer config to `public/config.local.json`, verifies reachable ports, and prints the localhost and LAN endpoint sheet.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop dev processes started by the script. Supabase containers keep their local data in Docker volumes; use `npm run supabase:stop` when you want to stop the stack.

## Runtime Config

`public/config.js` is the committed browser loader. It synchronously loads one JSON config file:

- `public/config.local.json` when `#{CONFIG_FILE}#` has not been substituted
- the substituted `#{CONFIG_FILE}#` path when present

`public/config.json` is the committed deployment template and should be substituted by CI/CD. `npm run get-going` generates ignored `public/config.local.json` for the current machine/LAN. Visual tests keep their config under `tests/visual/config.test.json` and route it as `/config.local.json`.
